Blocklists are typically used in order to filter 3rd party resources. The primary limitation of blocklists is that they are manually curated. To overcome that limitation, we hope to show a model of machine learning which can predict and filter 3rd party resources on websites. The dataset for this project will obtained by crawling websites and collating a list of loaded resources . On this dataset we will be using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to train a classifier model that can predict which of those resources are 3rd party. The model will be trained on an older version of the EasyList Blocklist then predict ads using a newer version of EasyList as ground truth. There will be three models, 1 month old EasyList, 3 month old EasyList, and 6 month old EasyList.
