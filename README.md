Blocklists are typically used in order to filter 3rd party resources. The primary limitation of blocklists is that they are manually curated. To overcome that limitation, we hope to show a model of machine learning which can predict and filter 3rd party resources on websites. The dataset for this project will obtained by crawling websites and collating a list of loaded resources . On this dataset we will be using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and neural networks to train classifier models that can predict which of those resources are 3rd party. The models will be trained on an older version of the EasyList Blocklist then predict ads using a newer version of EasyList as ground truth. There will be three models, 1 month old EasyList, 3 month old EasyList, and 6 month old EasyList.
