Block lists are typically used in order to filter 3rd party resources. The primary limitation of blocklists is that they are manually curated. To overcome that limitation, we hope to show a model of machine learning which can predict and filter 3rd party resources on websites. We created models from two separate learning algorithms, K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network (NN). The models will be trained on an older version of the EasyList Blocklist then predict ads using a newer version of EasyList as ground truth. There will be six total models with two for each algorithm coming from, 1 month old EasyList, 3 month old EasyList, and 6 month old EasyList.
